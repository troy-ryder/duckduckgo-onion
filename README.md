# duckduckgo-onion
DuckDuckGo onion search extension

This extension was made in response to [this issue] (https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/issues/905). User wanted to access onion site from address bar.

This extension was created using the duck duck go privacy extension repository and slightly modifying the firefox build.
